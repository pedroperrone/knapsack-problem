## Dependencies
* Ruby 2.5.1

## The Knapsack Problem
The Knapsack Problem is a famous problem in the computer science, being the Binary Knapsack Problem the most famous one and the one studied in this repository. An instance of this problems receives a weight capacity for a knapsack and a list of items. Each one of these items has a value and a weight. The questios aproached by the problem is `what is the greatest value that the knapsack can carrie?`

## The solution
The solution implemented here makes use of dynamic programming. This m√©thod is based on the ideia of optimal substructure, wich means the following: if the problem `A` is contained in `B`, then the best solution for the problem `A` is contained in the best solution for the problem `B`.
This implementation uses a matrix with `number of items` rows and `knapsack_capacity + 1` columns to save the solutions for the subproblems.
